# Bikesharing #
This analysis utilized Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python to clean data and create a Tableau story to determine how to successfully translate bikesharing data from New York City to a successful bikesharing launch in Des Moines, Iowa.

### Results ### 

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)

**Trip Duration**
![Trip Duration](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Time.png)

The overall trend is that trips are incredibly short - a vast majority of users are riding for less than an hour, peaking overall at about 10 minutes.
The trend tracks between men & women, unknown trends a little flatter toward a slightly longer ride. Mostly, this indicates that men are the largest demographic.

When translating this to Des Moines, I would consider that any ride is likely going to look a little longer depending on the locations chosen. Midwest distance and Manhatten distance are definitely not the same, and customers might be willing to take longer rides for the right destinations.

**Starting & Ending Points in NYC**

While understanding the target demographic for the biking service is a helpful piece of analysis, I would consider the placement of the bikes even more crucial. Comparing New York City to Des Moines is a little challenge, but there are some over-arching key clues to leverage.

![NYC Start](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Starting%20Locations%20-%20Unmarked.png)

Top 5 Starting: Pershing Square (Grand Central Terminal), E 17th & Broadway (Union Square Park), West St. & Chambers Street (Near schools, Rockefeller Park, and One World Obersrvatory), 12 Ave & W 40th St (Lincoln Tunnel), 8th Ave & W 31 St (Penn Station)

The Top 5 Ending stations appear to align with the top starting locations, indicating these are simply popular stops.

Many of these common spots are near parks, transit hubs (Grand Central Station), or near the Hudson. Usage got lighter starting at and going north from Central Park, and outside of Manhatten. The Financial Distrisct did look quite a bit lighter, but the trip timing indicates spikes during traditional commute times M-F 8 to 5. 



There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

###Summary###
Overall, I believe that a bikesharing culture could work in Des Moines, utilizing lessons learned from the NYC bikesharing. Here are some of the questions I'd ask to move forward in Des Moines:

  * Are colleges and univeristies part of the strategy? Based on the popular starting and ending points, there does appear to be a high volume of usage near NYU and a couple of high schools in Manhatten.
  * ![]()
  * ![]()
  * Could biking be part of the culture at the Iowa State Fair? Partner with the butter booth and do some "Bike to Butter" promos?
