# Bikesharing #
This analysis utilized Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python to clean data and create a Tableau story to determine how to successfully translate bikesharing data from New York City to a successful bikesharing launch in Des Moines, Iowa.

Overview of the statistical analysis:



The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt)

Results:

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
**Viz 1 & 2 Trip Duration**
These trips are incredibly short

The trends track between men & women, unknown trends a little flatter toward a slightly longer ride. Mostly, this indicates that men are the largest demographic.


**Viz 3 & 4 & 5 Trips by Gender, Day, and Time**


**Starting & Ending Points in NYC**
While understanding the target demographic for the biking service is a helpful piece of analysis, I would consider the placement of the bikes even more crucial. Comparing New York City to Des Moines is a little challenge, but there are some over-arching key clues to leverage.

[NYC Start](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Starting%20Locations%20-%20Unmarked.png)
Top 5: Pershing Square (Grand Central Terminal), E 17th & Broadway (Union Square Park), West St. & Chambers Street (Near schools, Rockefeller Park, and One World Obersrvatory), 12 Ave & W 40th St (Lincoln Tunnel), 8th Ave & W 31 St (Penn Station)


[NYC End](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Ending%20Locations%20-%20Unmarked.png)
The top Ending stations appear to align with the top starting locations, indicating these are simply popular stops.

On both maps, I circled notable hotspots where I had knowledge of what was in the general area. Many of these common spots are near parks, transit hubs (Grand Central Station), or near the Hudson. Usage got lighter starting at and going north from Central Park, and outside of Manhatten. The Financial Distrisct did look quite a bit lighter, indicating the more traditional office worker might be less likely to utilize the service. In conjunction with the data showing utilization times

Could biking be part of the culture at the Iowa State Fair? Partner with the butter booth and do "Bike to Butter"


There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
